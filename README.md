# Taschenrechner

This is my project for developing kind a little calculator in the terminal.
I will also use this document as diary for my plans and upcoming feature but also for my problems starting with C++.
To be precise i am not a skilled programmer in any programmning language.

*Roadmap:
1) Developing a good input interface.
2) First calculations (+ , -)
3) Using Functions
